# Diff

The diff component is used to display changes between two versions of a document or code. It highlights additions, deletions, and modifications in a clear and visually distinct manner.

## example

<article class="diff">Here's some text that has been modified.
   <span class="diff-added">This is an addition.</span>
   <span class="diff-deletion">This is a deletion.</span>
And this part is unchanged.
</article>
