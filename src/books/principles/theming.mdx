# Theming and overriding the theme colors

Cyan Design System provides a set of color tokens that can be used to create a consistent look and feel across the app. 

The simplest way to override the theme colors is to use the `:root` selector in your CSS and set the
chroma-prefixed color tokens to your desired values. This will override the default theme colors and apply
them across the app.

## Demo

import ThemeSwitcher from '../../components/principles/ThemeSwitcher.astro'

<ThemeSwitcher />

import ThemeColorDemo from '../../components/principles/ThemeColorDemo.astro'

<ThemeColorDemo scale="surface"/>
<ThemeColorDemo scale="primary"/>
