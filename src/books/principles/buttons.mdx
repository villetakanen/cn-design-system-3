# Buttons

Cyan Design System provides styling for `<button>` elements and `<a>` elements that are used as buttons. The styling is based on the [Material Design](https://material.io/components/buttons) guidelines for buttons.

Buttons are designed to be accessible and to provide a consistent look and feel across the app. They conform to touch targets and are designed to be used with the `:focus-visible` pseudo-class to provide a consistent focus style across the app.

## Demo

<div class="grid two-col">
  <div class="light border border-radius p-1 surface">
    <h3>LIGHT</h3>
    <ButtonDemo />
  </div>
  <div class="dark border border-radius p-1 surface">
    <h3>DARK</h3>
    <ButtonDemo />
  </div>
</div>

<div class="flex flex-col full-width">
  <button>Stretched</button>
</div>
